A machine learning model that predicts Formula 1 race winners based on historical data (1950-2020).

Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook Formula1prediction-checkpoint.ipynb
Sample Input:

Enter driver name (e.g., hamilton): hamilton
Enter constructor/team (e.g., mercedes): mercedes
Enter starting grid position (e.g., 1): 1
Enter race year (e.g., 2020): 2020
Enter round (e.g., 1): 2
Enter circuit (e.g., silverstone): silverstone
Enter weather (Sunny/Rainy/Cloudy): sunny

Dataset
From Kaggle:
results.csv
races.csv
drivers.csv
